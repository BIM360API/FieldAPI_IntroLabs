  Field API Intro Training Labs 
=================================

This folder contains introductory materials for BIM 360 Field API.

The labs consist of four modules. Starting from Lab1, it incrementally 
adds code or reuse the code you have written, and implement a simple web service application  
 

Lab1: HelloFieldWorld 
---------------------  

The minimum project that demonstrates how to make Field REST API call. In this lab, you learn what REST API is, how to make a request and obtain response, and login to Field web services through API. 


Lab2: FieldAPIIntro 
-------------------

In this lab, you will learn how to access to a project list and a issue list in the Field, and create a new issue. (It also includes a chart as a reference, but explanation is in Lab4.)


Lab3: FieldAPIWebIntro
----------------------

In the previous two labs, we looked at Field API as desktop client application. In this lab, we write a minimum, single page web service in APS.NET. We will reuse most of Field API call itself, and add UI layers as a web page.   


Lab4: FieldAPIWebIntroEx
------------------------

This is a bonus lab. It demonstrates a simple reporting feature by adding a chart showing the numbers of issue by status. No new Field API is used in this lab.
